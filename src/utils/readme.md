# OSCAL Utilities

The OSCAL project maintains [a list of tools for OSCAL on our web site](https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/tools/ "OSCAL tools page").

Additionally, we maintain a repository of tools at https://github.com/usnistgov/oscal-tools; and members of the community offer OSCAL tools, frequently in open repositories free to use, which we do not maintain.

Functionality archived here includes:

`resolver-pipeline` a demonstration implementation of OSCAL Profile resolution.

`oscal-content-validator.py` - a Python shell for configuration and running (XML and JSON )schema validation.
