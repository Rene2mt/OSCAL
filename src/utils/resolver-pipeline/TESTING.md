# Profile Resolver Pipeline Tests

The `testing/*` folders contain XSpec tests that indicate expected interim results of each XSLT transformation in the sequence.

Note that these interim results are _not necessarily valid to any OSCAL schema_, although they are quite close to OSCAL profile and catalog syntax.

The files in `testing/*` are only for this implementation. Implementation-independent tests and sample files for profile resolution are [with the specification](../../specifications/profile-resolution).
